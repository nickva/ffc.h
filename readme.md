## ffc.h
A direct and faithful c99 single-header port of Daniel Lemire's fast_float library.

See [fast_float](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float) for much more information on the algorithm and other
characteristics of the approach.

Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define FFC_IMPL
#include "ffc.h"

int main(void) {
   char *input = "-1234.0e10";
   ffc_outcome outcome;
   double d = ffc_parse_double_simple(strlen(input), input, &outcome);
   printf("%s is %f\n", input, d);

   char *int_input = "-42";
   int64_t out;
   ffc_parse_i64(strlen(int_input), int_input, 10, &out);
   printf("%s is %lld\n", int_input, out);

   return 0;
}
```

For use within a larger parser, where you don't expect to reach the end of input, use
the non-simple variants as the `ffc_result` includes the stopping point, just like in fast_float

## TODO

- [ ] Add the other integer overloads (exposing options)
- [ ] Post benchmarks. We rely on constant folding, and resulting branch elimination, so must be careful

## Caveats
- Does not support wide chars; only 1-byte strings (e.g., UTF8) are supported.
- The 32-bit architecture code is untested
